I’m a software engineer with over 8 years of experience in backend development and a growing interest in distributed systems, microservices, software architecture, and observability.

As of now I’m diving deep into Go programming, distributed systems, and system design, and I'm looking for a Go opportunities.

This is my blog where I do technical writings about the things I believe are interesting, and might be useful for others (like you).

Tech stack of this website consist of:

* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) with a [Coder theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-coder)
* S3 used for a static website hosting
* [Giscus](https://giscus.app) for comments

The entire codebase is hosted publicly at GitHub, [here](https://github.com/piorus/piorus.com).
