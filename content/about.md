I’m an Software Engineer with over 8 years of experience in backend development and a growing interest in distributed systems, microservices, software architecture, and observability.

As of now I’m diving deep into Go programming, distributed systems, and modern system design, and I'm looking for a Go opportunities.

This is my blog where I do some technical writing about the things I believe are interesting, and might be useful for others.
